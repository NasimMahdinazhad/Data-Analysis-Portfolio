# Nasim Mahdinazhad - Data-Analysis-Portfolio
## About

I have an analytical background in linguistic data science and a strong foundation in language technology. Currently completing a vocational training program in Data Analytics, I’ve developed a deep interest in using data to uncover insights and support informed decision-making.

My portfolio highlights hands-on projects in exploratory data analysis and machine learning, using Python, R, and SQL for data manipulation, and tools like Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Tableau for visualization. I enjoy working with complex datasets, applying statistical methods and models, and turning data into clear, actionable insights.

Outside of structured learning, I actively explore new tools and techniques in the data space. I’m passionate about continuous learning and thrive in both independent and collaborative environments.

This repository is a work in progress — I’m actively building it to reflect my skills, share projects, and document my learning journey in data analytics.

### Instacart Basket Analysis 
**Description:** Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. While the company already has strong sales, it wants to gain deeper insight into its sales patterns. The stakeholders are particularly interested in understanding the diversity of customers in their database and their purchasing behaviors. They believe a single marketing approach may not be effective for all customers and are therefore considering a targeted marketing strategy. Their goal is to reach different customer groups with relevant marketing campaigns and evaluate whether these campaigns impact product sales. 

**Goal:** perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of Instacart Basket data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. The
stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions:

**Tool:** Python (Jupyter Notebooks) and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn)

**Skills:** Data wrangling, EDA (exploratory data analysis), data visualizations, and making a final report.
