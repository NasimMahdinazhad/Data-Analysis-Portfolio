# Data-Analysis-Portfolio
Hi, I'm Nasim! I have an analytical background in linguistic data science and a strong foundation in language technology. I’m currently completing a vocational training program in Data Analytics and have developed a deep passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. 

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve developed the ability to work with complex datasets, identify patterns, and extract actionable insights. My experience includes data modelling and advanced statistical analysis—skills I’m eager to apply in a role as an entry-level data analyst.

Outside of structured learning, I enjoy exploring new tools and methodologies in the data space. I’m passionate about continuous learning and thrive in both collaborative environments and independent projects.

This repository is a space to share projects, demonstrate skills, and document my learning journey in data analytics.
