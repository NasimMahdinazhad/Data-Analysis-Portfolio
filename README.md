## About
Hi, I'm Nasim! I have an analytical background in linguistic data science and a strong foundation in language technology. I’m currently completing a vocational training program in Data Analytics and have developed a deep passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. 

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve developed the ability to work with complex datasets, identify patterns, and extract actionable insights. My experience includes data modelling and advanced statistical analysis—skills I’m eager to apply in a role as an entry-level data analyst.

Outside of structured learning, I enjoy exploring new tools and methodologies in the data space. I’m passionate about continuous learning and thrive in both collaborative environments and independent projects.

This repository is a space to share projects, demonstrate skills, and document my learning journey in data analytics.

### Rockbuster Stealth LLC 
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former global movie rental chain, plans to launch an online video rental service using its existing film licenses. The dataset includes information on film inventory, customers, payments, among other things. The goal of this project was to support the company’s online launch strategy by answering key business questions with data-driven insights. This project includes the following steps: data loading into the PostgreSQL database, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), and presenting results by creating visualizations. 

Key questions:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
