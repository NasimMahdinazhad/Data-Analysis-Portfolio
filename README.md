# Nasim Mahdinazhad - Data-Analysis-Portfolio
## About

I have an analytical background in linguistic data science and a strong foundation in language technology. Currently completing a vocational training program in Data Analytics, I’ve developed a deep interest in using data to uncover insights and support informed decision-making.

My portfolio highlights hands-on projects in exploratory data analysis and machine learning, using Python, R, and SQL for data manipulation, and tools like Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Tableau for visualization. I enjoy working with complex datasets, applying statistical methods and models, and turning data into clear, actionable insights.

Outside of structured learning, I actively explore new tools and techniques in the data space. I’m passionate about continuous learning and thrive in both independent and collaborative environments.

This repository is a work in progress — I’m actively building it to reflect my skills, share projects, and document my learning journey in data analytics.

## Portfolio Projects
This section lists data analytics projects with short overviews of the tools used.
### Rockbuster Stealth LLC 
**Description:** Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former global movie rental chain, plans to launch an online video rental service using its existing film licenses. The dataset includes information on film inventory, customers, payments, among other things. This project included the following steps: data loading into the PostgreSQL database, data preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), and presenting results by creating visualizations.

**Goal:** The goal of this project was to support the company’s online launch strategy by answering their following key business questions with data-driven insights. 

_● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?_

_● What was the average rental duration for all videos?_

_● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?_

_● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?_

_● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?_

**Tool:** PostgreSQL

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views

### Instacart Basket Analysis 
**Description:** Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. While the company already has strong sales, it wants to gain deeper insight into its sales patterns. The stakeholders are particularly interested in understanding the diversity of customers in their database and their purchasing behaviors. They believe a single marketing approach may not be effective for all customers and are therefore considering a targeted marketing strategy. Their goal is to reach different customer groups with relevant marketing campaigns and evaluate whether these campaigns impact product sales. 

**Goal:** perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of Instacart Basket data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. The
stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions:

_● What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day in terms of order volume?_

_● Are there specific times of day when customers tend to spend the most money?_

_● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?_

_● What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty?_

_● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?_

_● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?_

_● Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?_

_● What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?_

_● What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles such as order price, ordering frequency, and the types of products purchased?_

**Tool:** Python (Jupyter Notebooks) and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn)

**Skills:** Data wrangling, EDA (exploratory data analysis), data visualizations, and making a final report.
