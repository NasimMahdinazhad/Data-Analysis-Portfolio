# Nasim Mahdinazhad - Data-Analysis-Portfolio
## About

I have an analytical background in linguistic data science and a strong foundation in language technology. 
My portfolio highlights hands-on projects in exploratory data analysis and machine learning using Python, R, and SQL for data manipulation, and Tableau for data visualization. I am passionate about exploring complex datasets to reveal hidden patterns and clear insights. By applying rigorous statistical methods and analytical thinking, I aim to translate data into strategic recommendations that inform decision-making and drive tangible impact.

Outside of structured learning, I actively explore new tools and techniques in the data space. I’m committed to continuous growth and thrive in both independent projects and collaborative, team-driven environments.

This repository is a work in progress; I’m actively building it to reflect my skills, share projects, and document my learning journey in data analytics.
