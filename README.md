# Nasim Mahdinazhad - Data-Analysis-Portfolio
## About

I have an analytical background in linguistic data science and a strong foundation in language technology. 
My portfolio highlights hands-on projects in exploratory data analysis and machine learning using Python, R, and SQL for data manipulation, and Tableau for data visualization. I am passionate about exploring complex datasets to reveal hidden patterns and clear insights. By applying rigorous statistical methods and analytical thinking, I aim to translate data into strategic recommendations that inform decision-making and drive tangible impact.

Outside of structured learning, I actively explore new tools and techniques in the data space. I’m committed to continuous growth and thrive in both independent projects and collaborative, team-driven environments.

This repository is a work in progress; I’m actively building it to reflect my skills, share projects, and document my learning journey in data analytics.

### Instacart Basket Analysis 
**Description:** Instacart, an online grocery app, seeks deeper insight into customer diversity and purchasing behavior to move from a one-size-fits-all approach toward targeted marketing strategies. 

**Goal:** The goal is to analyze Instacart basket data to uncover insights that support customer segmentation, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and assessing their impact on sales.

**Tool:** Python (Jupyter Notebooks) and relevant libraries (Pandas, NumPy, os, Matplotlib, Scipy, and Seaborn)

**Skills:** Data wrangling, EDA (exploratory data analysis), data visualizations, and making a final report.

**Files:** [Instacart Basket Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/NasimMahdinazhad/Instacart-Basket-Analysis/blob/main/Analysis.ipynb),
           [Final Report](https://github.com/NasimMahdinazhad/Instacart-Basket-Analysis/blob/main/Report%20%26%20Insights.pdf)

### Historical Network Analysis 
**Description:** the Institute for Public Policy believes that past events heavily influence the current geopolitical climate. To delve deeper into this hypothesis, a clearer understanding of the historical relationships between countries in the twentieth century is needed.

**Goal:** To provide an analytical overview and visualization of the interrelations between countries throughout the twentieth century, highlighting historical ties that can help the Institute better understand the dynamics of world politics during this volatile period.

**Tool:** Python (Jupyter lab) and relevant libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Networkx, Scipy, re, Os, Matplotlib, and Spacy)

**Skills:** Text mining, natural language processing (NLP), network analysis visualization.
